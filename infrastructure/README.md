# Infrastructure

## 🔗 Navigation
- [⬆ Parent](./../README.md)
- [🏠 Root](./../README.md)
- [📂 Current Directory](././)

## 📌 Overview
This directory serves as the hub for all infrastructure-related documentation, including cloud services, containerization, and web servers. It focuses on how applications are deployed, managed, and served.

## 📁 Contents
- [cloud](./cloud/README.md): Documentation for major cloud platforms like [AWS](./cloud/aws/README.md) and Microsoft [Azure](./cloud/azure/README.md).
- [containers](./containers/README.md): Resources for containerization technologies, primarily [Docker](./containers/linux-docker.md) and management tools like [Portainer](./containers/portainer.md).
- [web-servers](./web-servers/README.md): Configuration and best practices for web servers such as [Nginx](./web-servers/nginx.md).

## 🧠 Responsibilities
This section is responsible for providing technical guidance on environment setup, deployment strategies, and infrastructure management. It ensures a consistent approach to hosting and scaling applications.

## 🔄 Relationships
This directory is a direct child of the root. It provides the execution environment for code documented in [development](./../development/README.md) and is managed using practices defined in [systems](./../systems/README.md).
