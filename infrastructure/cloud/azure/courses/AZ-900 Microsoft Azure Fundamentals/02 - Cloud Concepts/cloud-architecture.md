## Parent Context

This document is part of the "Cloud Concepts" module within the AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course.

## Contents Overview

This file provides a comprehensive explanation of the three primary cloud architecture models: Private Cloud, Public Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud. It includes a description of each model, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and tips for choosing the appropriate model.

## Role in System

Understanding these cloud architecture models is fundamental for designing and implementing cloud solutions effectively. This document helps in making informed decisions about where to deploy applications and data, balancing factors like control, cost, scalability, and security.

## Key Cloud Architecture Models

### EXAM TIPS

Choose your cloud architecture model wisely based on your business needs and requirements.

### Private Cloud

An organization creates and controls its own cloud environment, often on its own hardware, while still gaining benefits similar to a public cloud.

| Pros                                 | Cons        |
| :----------------------------------- | :---------- |
| Complete control of infrastructure   | Maintenance |
| Benefits of public cloud             | Staffing    |
| Better security and privacy          |             |

### Public Cloud

Cloud services offered by third-party providers over the public internet, available to anyone. Examples include Azure, AWS, and GCP.

| Pros                                                            | Cons                                  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| No purchase of hardware                                         | No control over features and versions |
| Low monthly fees (pay-as-you-go)                                | No physical access                    |

### Hybrid Cloud

A computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

| Pros                                  | Cons                   |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| Avoid disruptions and outages         | Complex infrastructure |
| Adhere to regulation, governance, etc. |                        |
| Span both public and private cloud    |                        |
