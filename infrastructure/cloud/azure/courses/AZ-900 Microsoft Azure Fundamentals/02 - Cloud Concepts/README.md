# AZ-900 Module 02 - Cloud Concepts

## 🔗 Navigation
- [⬆ Parent](./../README.md)
- [🏠 Root](./../../../../../README.md)
- [📂 Current Directory](././)

<h2> 📌 Overview</h2>
This module introduces fundamental cloud computing concepts, including terminology, economic models, service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), cloud deployment models (public, private, hybrid), and the Azure Marketplace. It also touches on the shared responsibility model, building a solid theoretical foundation for Azure.

<h2> 📁 Contents</h2>
- [images](./images/README.md): Visual aids and diagrams related to cloud concepts.
- [azure-marketplace.md](./azure-marketplace.md): Details about the Azure Marketplace.
- [cloud-architecture.md](./cloud-architecture.md): Explores different cloud architecture models.
- [cloud-service-models.md](./cloud-service-models.md): Explains Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
- [language-cloud-computing.md](./language-cloud-computing.md): Defines key terms in cloud computing (e.g., high availability, scalability).
- [language-cloud-economics.md](./language-cloud-economics.md): Discusses Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) in a cloud context.
- [README.md](./README.md): This file, providing an overview of cloud concepts.

<h2> 🧠 Responsibilities</h2>
This module is crucial for building a solid theoretical foundation in cloud computing, which is essential for understanding how Azure services function and how they can be applied effectively. It covers the core principles that underpin all cloud-based solutions.

<h2> 🔄 Relationships</h2>
This directory is a child of the [AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](./../README.md) course. Its foundational concepts are prerequisites for understanding the [Azure Architecture](./../03 - Azure Architecture/README.md) and [Compute](./../04 - Compute/README.md) modules, and broadly relate to all topics within the [cloud](./../../../../README.md) section.

<h2> 📚 Cloud Concepts Summary</h2>

### [Language of Cloud Computing](./language-cloud-computing.md)
Covers terms like high availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery, scalability, elasticity, and agility. Describes stable and dependable cloud computing, the ability to adapt to changes in resource demand, user base, and application usage.

### [Language of Cloud Economics](./language-cloud-economics.md)
Discusses CapEx and OpEx as costs for computing. OpEx is a key characteristic of cloud computing with its pay-as-you-go model.

### [Cloud Service Models](./cloud-service-models.md)
Introduces IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, which are the fundamental cloud service models encompassing nearly all Azure products and services. The shared responsibility model dictates whether you or Microsoft is responsible for a cloud service.

### [Azure Marketplace](./azure-marketplace.md)
An extra layer of functionality for your cloud applications, allowing users to integrate third-party products and services.

### [Cloud Architecture Models](./cloud-architecture.md)
Explores private, public, and hybrid approaches to using cloud computing for your business.
