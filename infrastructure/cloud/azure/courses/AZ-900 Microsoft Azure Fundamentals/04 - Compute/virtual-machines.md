## Parent Context

This document is part of the "Compute Services" module within the AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course.

## Contents Overview

This file provides a comprehensive overview of Azure Virtual Machines, detailing what a VM is in the Azure context, its key features, pricing model, and various use cases. It also highlights that VMs are an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering and includes relevant images.

## Role in System

Azure Virtual Machines are a foundational compute offering, allowing users to deploy and manage virtualized operating systems and applications in the cloud. This document helps in understanding the flexibility and control VMs provide, making them suitable for a wide range of workloads from development and testing to production applications.

## Key Concepts and Features

### EXAM TIPS

Virtual Machines are the core of Azure compute and are widely used.

-   A VM is your machine exclusively.
-   You don't buy, own, or control any hardware; Azure manages this.
-   VMs are an **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)** offering, meaning you are responsible for the entire machine (OS, applications, data).
-   Azure VMs take advantage of various Azure tools for management and monitoring.
-   Pricing scales with resources, and you typically pay by the hour for usage.

### What is a Virtual Machine?

-   A computer or server you have exclusive access to in the cloud.
-   It doesn't have its own exclusive physical hardware; instead, it runs on virtualized hardware.

### Features

Azure Virtual Machines come with a rich set of features:
