## Parent Context

This document is part of the "Introduction to Azure" module within the AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course.

## Contents Overview

This file introduces Azure PowerShell, explaining what a Cmdlet is, how PowerShell integrates with Azure Resource Manager, and highlighting its versatility beyond Azure-specific tasks.

## Role in System

Azure PowerShell provides a powerful command-line interface for managing Azure resources through scripting. This document helps users understand its basic components and its role in automating complex Azure operations and integrating with broader IT automation workflows.

## Key Concepts

### Cmdlet

A Cmdlet (pronounced "command-let") is a lightweight command that performs a single function in PowerShell.

-   **Example**: `"New-AzVm"` is a Cmdlet used to create a new Azure Virtual Machine.

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Integration

-   PowerShell also uses the Azure Resource Manager, similar to the Azure Portal, to manipulate Azure resources. This ensures consistency and declarative management of infrastructure.

### Versatile

-   PowerShell's capabilities extend beyond Azure. It can be used for many other tasks and areas, such as Windows administration, making it a flexible tool in a diverse IT environment.
