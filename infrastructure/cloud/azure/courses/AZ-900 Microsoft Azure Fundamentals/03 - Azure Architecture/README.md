- [📂 Current Directory](././)

<h2> 📌 Overview</h2>
This module focuses on the fundamental architectural components of Azure, including its global infrastructure, resource organization, and management principles. It covers Azure regions, availability zones, resource groups, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM), essential for designing resilient cloud solutions.

<h2> 📁 Contents</h2>
- [images](./images/README.md): Visual aids and diagrams related to Azure architecture.
- [regions-and-availability-zones.md](./regions-and-availability-zones.md): Explains Azure's global infrastructure with regions and availability zones.
- [rg-and-arm.md](./rg-and-arm.md): Details Azure Resource Groups and the Azure Resource Manager.
- [README.md](./README.md): This file, providing an overview of Azure architecture.

<h2> 🧠 Responsibilities</h2>
This module is essential for understanding how Azure services are physically and logically organized. It provides the knowledge necessary to design resilient, scalable, and manageable cloud solutions by leveraging Azure's foundational architectural elements.

<h2> 🔄 Relationships</h2>
This directory is a child of the [AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](./../README.md) course. Concepts here underpin all other Azure services, especially [Compute](./../04 - Compute/README.md) resources, and build upon the [Cloud Concepts](./../02 - Cloud Concepts/README.md) module.
