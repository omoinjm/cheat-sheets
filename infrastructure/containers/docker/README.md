<h2> 🔄 Relationships</h2>
This directory is a child of the [cloud](./../README.md) directory. Its contents are highly relevant for deploying applications developed in the [languages](./../../../languages/README.md) section (e.g., [C#](./../../../languages/c-sharp.md), [Python](./../../../languages/python/README.md)) and databases like [SQL Server](./../../../languages/sqlserver.md) or [Azure Container Instances](./../azure/courses/AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals/04 - Compute/azure-container-instances.md). It also integrates with cloud providers like [AWS](./../aws/README.md) and [Azure](./../azure/README.md).
