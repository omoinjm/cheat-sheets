## Parent Context

This document is part of the Linux operating system documentation, focusing on containerization with Docker.

## Contents Overview

This file provides a guide on how to use Docker on Linux, including installation steps, managing persistent storage with volumes, migrating applications into Docker containers, and a reference to Portainer for Docker resource management.

## Role in System

Docker is a fundamental tool for modern application deployment and management, allowing applications to be packaged into isolated containers. This document serves as a practical guide for setting up and utilizing Docker on a Linux environment.

## Key Concepts and Commands

### STEP 1 - Docker Engine Installation

Instructions for installing Docker Engine and Docker Compose on Ubuntu are referenced from the official Docker documentation.

**Post-installation commands:**

```bash
# Add user to the `docker` group to run docker commands:
sudo usermod -aG docker your_username

# Verify that the `docker.sock` file has appropriate permissions:
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock

# If ownership is incorrect, change it:
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
```

### STEP 2 - Persistent Storage with Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by Docker containers.

```bash
# Run container with a named volume
docker run -p 80:80 -v nginx_data:/var/www/html -d nginx

# Remove container (data in volume persists)
docker rm <container id>

# List all Docker volumes
docker volume ls
```

### STEP 3 - How to Migrate Data into Docker Container?

Understanding where Docker volumes store data and how to inject data into containers.

```bash
# Inspect volume data location
docker inspect nginx_data

# Example of mounting a host directory as a volume
docker run -p 80:80 -v /var/www/html:/var/www/html -d nginx
```

### STEP 4 - Manage Docker Resources with Portainer

This section refers to using Portainer for managing Docker environments.
