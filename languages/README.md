<h2> 📁 Contents</h2>
- [[c & c++/README|c & c++]]: Notes and concepts specific to C and C++ programming languages.
- [[images/README|images]]: Image assets used within the language documentation.
- [[python/README|python]]: Documentation, code snippets, and utilities for the Python programming language.
- [[c-sharp.md]]: Notes and code snippets for C# programming.

<h2> 🧠 Responsibilities</h2>
This section is responsible for offering a quick reference for language-specific details, helping to onboard new team members, and ensuring consistent coding practices across different projects. It centralizes essential information for efficient multi-language development.

<h2> 🔄 Relationships</h2>
This directory is a direct child of the root. Its content is fundamental for development work documented elsewhere in the repository, such as [[../cloud/README|cloud]]-based applications or [[../os/README|operating system]] scripting. It may also provide context for [[../systems/README|system design]] where language choice is a factor.
