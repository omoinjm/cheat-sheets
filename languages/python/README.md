## Parent Context

This directory is part of the programming languages knowledge base, specifically for the Python programming language.

## Contents Overview

This directory contains various Python scripts and modules that demonstrate specific functionalities, architectural patterns, or utility functions, particularly focusing on authentication and API control.

### Files

-   [auth.py](./auth.py): Contains functions or classes related to authentication logic.
-   [controller.py](./controller.py): Implements controller logic, likely for handling requests in a web application or API.
-   [jwt_cache.py](./jwt_cache.py): Manages caching of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for efficient reuse.

## Role in System

This section serves as a practical collection of Python code examples and utilities. It can be used for reference, as starting points for new projects, or to illustrate best practices in Python development, especially concerning security (auth, JWT) and application structure (controller).
