# Operating Systems

## 🔗 Navigation
- [[../README|⬆ Parent]]
- [[../README|🏠 Root]]
- [[./|📂 Current Directory]]

## 📌 Overview
This directory contains documentation, configurations, and scripts for various operating systems. It is divided into subdirectories for each OS, serving as a centralized location for OS-specific knowledge.

## 📁 Contents
- [[linux/README|linux]]: Documentation for Linux-based operating systems.
- [[windows/README|windows]]: Documentation for Windows-based operating systems.
- [[README.md]]: This file, providing an overview of the `os` directory.

## 🧠 Responsibilities
This directory is responsible for holding all documentation related to operating systems. It categorizes information by OS to ensure that platform-specific guides, scripts, and configurations are easy to locate and manage.

## 🔄 Relationships
As a primary category under the root, this directory is a sibling to other major sections like [[../languages/README|languages]] and [[../cloud/README|cloud]]. The information contained here may be referenced by scripts or documentation in other parts of the repository, particularly where setup or execution is OS-dependent.
