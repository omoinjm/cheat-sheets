# Programming Languages Knowledge Base

## 🔗 Navigation
- [Parent](./../README.md)
- [Root](./../README.md)
- [Current Directory](././)

## 📌 Overview
This directory serves as a centralized knowledge base for various programming languages, their syntax, features, common patterns, and related technologies. It includes specific documentation for different languages and associated images, vital for developers.

<h2> 📁 Contents</h2>
- [c & c++](./c & c++/README.md): Notes and concepts specific to C and C++ programming languages.
- [images](./images/README.md): Image assets used within the language documentation.
- [python](./python/README.md): Documentation, code snippets, and utilities for the Python programming language.
- [c-sharp.md](./c-sharp.md): Notes and code snippets for C# programming.
- [jwt.md](./jwt.md): Documentation related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- [markdown.md](./markdown.md): Guide and best practices for using Markdown.
- [sqlserver.md](./sqlserver.md): Notes specific to SQL Server syntax and features.
- [README.md](./README.md): This file, providing an overview of programming language documentation.

<h2> 🧠 Responsibilities</h2>
This section is responsible for offering a quick reference for language-specific details, helping to onboard new team members, and ensuring consistent coding practices across different projects. It centralizes essential information for efficient multi-language development.

<h2> 🔄 Relationships</h2>
This directory is a direct child of the root. Its content is fundamental for development work documented elsewhere in the repository, such as [cloud](./../cloud/README.md)-based applications or [operating system](./../os/README.md) scripting. It may also provide context for [system design](./../systems/README.md) where language choice is a factor.
