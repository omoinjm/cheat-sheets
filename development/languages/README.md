# Programming Languages

## 🔗 Navigation
- [⬆ Parent](./../README.md)
- [🏠 Root](./../../README.md)
- [📂 Current Directory](././)

## 📌 Overview
This directory serves as a centralized knowledge base for various programming languages, their syntax, features, common patterns, and related technologies. It includes specific documentation for different languages and associated images, vital for developers.

## 📁 Contents
- [c & c++](./c & c++/README.md): Notes and concepts specific to C and C++ programming languages.
- [python](./python/README.md): Documentation, code snippets, and utilities for the Python programming language.
- [c-sharp.md](./c-sharp.md): General notes and code snippets for C# programming.
- [c-sharp-docker.md](./c-sharp-docker.md): Guide for running C# applications in Docker containers.
- [markdown.md](./markdown.md): Guide and best practices for using Markdown.

## 🧠 Responsibilities
This section is responsible for offering a quick reference for language-specific details, helping to onboard new team members, and ensuring consistent coding practices across different projects. It centralizes essential information for efficient multi-language development.

## 🔄 Relationships
This directory is a child of [development](./../README.md). Its content is fundamental for development work documented elsewhere in the repository, such as [cloud](../../infrastructure/cloud/README.md)-based applications or [systems](../../systems/README.md) scripting.
