# Python Language Notes and Utilities

## 🔗 Navigation
- [Parent](./../README.md)
- [Root](./../../../README.md)
- [Current Directory](././)

## 📌 Overview
This directory contains various Python scripts and modules that demonstrate specific functionalities, architectural patterns, or utility functions, particularly focusing on authentication and API control. It serves as a practical collection of Python code examples and utilities.

<h2> 📁 Contents</h2>
- [auth.py](./auth.py): Contains functions or classes related to authentication logic.
- [controller.py](./controller.py): Implements controller logic, likely for handling requests in a web application or API.
- [jwt_cache.py](./jwt_cache.py): Manages caching of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for efficient reuse.
- [README.md](./README.md): This file, providing an overview of Python notes and utilities.

<h2> 🧠 Responsibilities</h2>
This section is responsible for providing practical Python code examples and utilities. It can be used for reference, as starting points for new projects, or to illustrate best practices in Python development, especially concerning security (auth, JWT) and application structure (controller).

<h2> 🔄 Relationships</h2>
This directory is a child of the [languages](./../README.md) directory. Its contents are particularly relevant for [cloud](./../../../cloud/README.md)-based backend services and APIs. The `jwt_cache.py` is directly related to the [JWT](./../../jwt.md) documentation in the parent `languages` directory.
