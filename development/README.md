# Development

## 🔗 Navigation
- [⬆ Parent](./../README.md)
- [🏠 Root](./../README.md)
- [📂 Current Directory](././)

## 📌 Overview
This directory serves as the primary hub for software development documentation. It covers programming languages, database management, and industry standards, providing a centralized resource for engineering knowledge and best practices.

## 📁 Contents
- [databases](./databases/README.md): Documentation for various database systems ([MSSQL](./databases/mssql-linux.md), [MySQL](./databases/mysql-docker.md), [PostgreSQL](./databases/postgres-linux.md)) and their containerized versions.
- [languages](./languages/README.md): Syntax guides, patterns, and documentation for programming languages like Python, C#, and C++.
- [standards](./standards/README.md): Industry standards and protocols, such as [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](./standards/jwt.md).

## 🧠 Responsibilities
This section is responsible for maintaining a structured repository of technical knowledge required for software construction. It ensures that developers have quick access to language specifications, database configurations, and standard implementation details.

## 🔄 Relationships
This directory is a direct child of the root. It provides the technical foundation for projects documented in [professional](./../professional/README.md) and utilizes tools and environments defined in [workspace](./../workspace/README.md) and [infrastructure](./../infrastructure/README.md).
