# Cloud Computing and Containerization

## 🔗 Navigation
- [[../README|⬆ Parent]]
- [[../README|🏠 Root]]
- [[./|📂 Current Directory]]

## 📌 Overview
This directory centralizes documentation and resources related to cloud computing platforms (AWS, Azure) and containerization technologies (Docker). It serves as a comprehensive guide for cloud-native development and operations.

<h2> 📁 Contents</h2>
- [[aws/README|aws]]: Documentation specific to Amazon Web Services.
- [[azure/README|azure]]: Documentation specific to Microsoft Azure.
- [[docker/README|docker]]: Notes and guides on using Docker for containerization.
- [[README.md]]: This file, providing an overview of cloud computing and containerization.

<h2> 🧠 Responsibilities</h2>
This section is vital for understanding, deploying, and managing applications and infrastructure across various cloud environments and leveraging containerization for scalable and portable solutions. It supports cloud-native development and operations.

<h2> 🔄 Relationships</h2>
This directory is a direct child of the root. Its contents are highly integrated with topics in [[../os/README|operating systems]] (especially Linux for server deployments and Docker), and development practices from the [[../languages/README|languages]] section, as cloud applications often rely on specific programming languages. Automation scripts within [[../os/linux/automation/README|os/linux/automation]] also frequently interact with cloud resources documented here.
