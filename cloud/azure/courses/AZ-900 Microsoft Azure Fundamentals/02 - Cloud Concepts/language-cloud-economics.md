## Parent Context

This document is part of the "Cloud Concepts" module within the AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course.

## Contents Overview

This file introduces key economic concepts relevant to cloud computing, specifically focusing on Capital Expenditure (CapEx) versus Operational Expenditure (OpEx) and various cloud pricing models. It explains how cloud computing shifts costs to a consumption-based, pay-as-you-go model.

## Role in System

Understanding cloud economics is vital for businesses making financial decisions about cloud adoption and resource allocation. This document helps in evaluating the cost implications of cloud services, optimizing spending, and leveraging the financial benefits of the cloud model.

## Key Concepts and Terms

### EXAM TIPS

**Using the right budget in a company can enable huge change.**

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

-   Buying hardware outright, paid upfront as a one-time purchase.
-   Money spent by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings, and equipment.
-   Involves large upfront investments.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

-   Ongoing costs needed to run your business.
-   Includes domain registration, power to run servers, and other annual costs.
-   Characterized by a pay-as-you-go model, common in cloud computing.

### Cloud Pricing Models

-   **Consumption-based pricing**: You pay only for the resources you use, not for the time they are turned on (e.g., per execution, per second, or a combination).
    -   *Example*: Azure Functions often use a consumption-based model.
-   **Hourly Pricing**: Common for resources like Virtual Machines (VMs) and App Services, where you pay for the time the resource is provisioned and running.
