## Parent Context

This directory contains the "Cloud Concepts" module for the AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification course.

## Contents Overview

This module introduces fundamental cloud computing concepts, including terminology, economic models, service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), cloud deployment models (public, private, hybrid), and the Azure Marketplace. It also touches on the shared responsibility model.

### Subdirectories

-   [images](./images/README.md): Visual aids and diagrams related to cloud concepts.

### Files

-   [azure-marketplace.md](./azure-marketplace.md): Details about the Azure Marketplace.
-   [cloud-architecture.md](./cloud-architecture.md): Explores different cloud architecture models.
-   [cloud-service-models.md](./cloud-service-models.md): Explains Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
-   [language-cloud-computing.md](./language-cloud-computing.md): Defines key terms in cloud computing (e.g., high availability, scalability).
-   [language-cloud-economics.md](./language-cloud-economics.md): Discusses Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) in a cloud context.

## Role in System

This module is crucial for building a solid theoretical foundation in cloud computing, which is essential for understanding how Azure services function and how they can be applied effectively. It covers the core principles that underpin all cloud-based solutions.

## Cloud Concepts Summary

### [Language of Cloud Computing](./language-cloud-computing.md)

Covers terms like high availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery, scalability, elasticity, and agility. Describes stable and dependable cloud computing, the ability to adapt to changes in resource demand, user base, and application usage.

### [Language of Cloud Economics](./language-cloud-economics.md)

Discusses CapEx and OpEx as costs for computing. OpEx is a key characteristic of cloud computing with its pay-as-you-go model.

### [Cloud Service Models](./cloud-service-models.md)

Introduces IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, which are the fundamental cloud service models encompassing nearly all Azure products and services. The shared responsibility model dictates whether you or Microsoft is responsible for a cloud service.

### [Azure Marketplace](./azure-marketplace.md)

An extra layer of functionality for your cloud applications, allowing users to integrate third-party products and services.

### [Cloud Architecture Models](./cloud-architecture.md)

Explores private, public, and hybrid approaches to using cloud computing for your business.
