## <mark>EXAM TIPS</mark>

Choose your cloud architecture model wisely.

- Private cloud is Azure on your own hardware in a location of your choice. All the benefits of public cloud, but you can lock it down. A lot of staff required.

- Public cloud is Azure, AWS, GCP. No upfront costs, but monthly usage. Little control over services and infrastructure.

- A hybrid cloud model is the best of private and public, but could be complex.
