## <mark>EXAM TIPS</mark>

Scale sets are taking VMs to the next level and keeping your sanity.

- Scale sets are identical VMs. They can be activated or deactivated as needed.

- A baseline VM for the scale set ensures application stability. A baseline VM is what you copy to make up the scale set VMs.

- As resource usage increases, more VMs are activated to take the load.

- You only pay for the VM, storage and networking resources you use. Nothing additional fo scale sets.
