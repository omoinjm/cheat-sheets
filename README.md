# Project Knowledge Map

This repository serves as a comprehensive, Obsidian-ready knowledge base. It contains a collection of curated code snippets, technical documentation, command references, and architectural notes across various technology domains. This root document acts as the primary Map of Content (MOC) for navigating the entire vault.

## 🔗 Navigation
- [[./|📂 Current Directory]]

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a personal knowledge base containing code snippets, technical documentation, and command references for a variety of tools and technologies. It is structured to be explored both on GitHub and within an Obsidian vault, with a focus on clear, linked, and discoverable information.

## 📁 Contents
- [[cloud/README|cloud]]: Cloud computing platforms, including AWS, Azure, and Docker.
- [[ide/README|ide]]: Configuration and usage of Integrated Development Environments.
- [[languages/README|languages]]: Programming language syntax, snippets, and best practices.
- [[os/README|os]]: Operating system configurations and commands.
- [[pen-testing/README|pen-testing]]: Tools and notes on penetration testing.
- [[systems/README|systems]]: System design and architecture notes.
- [[work/README|work]]: Work-related documentation.

## 🧠 Responsibilities
The root of the repository is responsible for providing the primary entry point and high-level structure for the entire knowledge base. It establishes the organizational principles and serves as the main navigational hub.

## 🔄 Relationships
This root directory is the top-level container for all other content. It is the parent of all the main category directories and does not have any sibling directories. All navigation flows downwards from this point into the more specialized subdirectories.
