# Project Knowledge Map

This repository serves as a comprehensive, Obsidian-ready knowledge base. It contains a collection of curated code snippets, technical documentation, command references, and architectural notes across various technology domains. This root document acts as the primary Map of Content (MOC) for navigating the entire vault.

## 🔗 Navigation

## 📌 Overview

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and collection of cheatsheets, encompassing everything I know about technology. It contains curated code snippets, technical documentation, and command references for a wide variety of tools and technologies. The content is structured for easy exploration on both GitHub and within an Obsidian vault, with a focus on clear, linked, and discoverable information.

## 🤖 AI Integration & Automation

This repository is optimized for AI-assisted maintenance. Any LLM (Gemini, Claude, GPT) can autonomously add, categorize, and link new content by following the **Wiki-fication Protocol**.

### How to Add New Content
To ensure new notes, tools, or prompts match the repository's structure, provide the following instruction to your AI assistant:

> "Add the following content to this Wiki-fied repository by following the **Automated Wiki Maintenance Protocol** located in `prompts/documentation/automated-wiki-maintenance.md`. Perform the categorization, frontmatter generation, MOC updates, and cross-linking autonomously."

## 🧠 Responsibilities

The root of the repository is responsible for providing the primary entry point and high-level structure for the entire knowledge base. It establishes the organizational principles and serves as the main navigational hub.

## 🔄 Relationships

This root directory is the top-level container for all other content. It is the parent of all the main category directories and does not have any sibling directories. All navigation flows downwards from this point into the more specialized subdirectories.
