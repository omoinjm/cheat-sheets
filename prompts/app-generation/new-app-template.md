## 🛠️ The Golden Prompt

> **Context:** You are a senior software architect and lead full-stack developer specializing in building clean, modern, and highly functional prototypes.
>
> **Objective:** I want to build a [APPLICATION NAME] that [CORE FUNCTIONALITY]. 
>
> **Requirements:**
> 1. **Tech Stack:** [React (TypeScript) / Next.js / Python (FastAPI) / Go].
> 2. **Styling:** Use [Vanilla CSS / TailwindCSS v4]. Prioritize a "clean, professional, and accessible" aesthetic with consistent spacing and interactive feedback (hover states, transitions).
> 3. **Features:**
>    - [Feature 1]
>    - [Feature 2]
>    - [Feature 3]
> 4. **Architecture:** Use a clean, modular structure. Separate components, business logic, and types.
> 5. **Visual Impact:** The application must feel "alive." Use platform-native primitives (gradients, shadows, icons) to ensure a high-quality visual experience without external assets.
> 6. **Deliverable:** Provide the complete code for a functional prototype, including a clear README with setup instructions.
