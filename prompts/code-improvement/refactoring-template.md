## 🛠️ The Golden Prompt

> **Context:** You are a senior software engineer and lead developer. You are an expert in writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code.
>
> **Objective:** I want you to refactor the following code to improve its [READABILITY / PERFORMANCE / MAINTAINABILITY].
>
> **Requirements:**
> 1. **Code:** [INSERT CODE HERE].
> 2. **Refactoring Goals:**
>    - [Goal 1] (e.g., Remove redundant logic)
>    - [Goal 2] (e.g., Improve naming conventions)
>    - [Goal 3] (e.g., Extract complex logic into reusable functions)
> 3. **Constraints:**
>    - [Constraint 1] (e.g., Maintain existing functionality)
>    - [Constraint 2] (e.g., Do not introduce external dependencies)
> 4. **Output:** Provide the refactored code, a brief explanation of the changes made, and a set of unit tests to verify the correctness of the refactored code.
