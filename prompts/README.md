# Prompt Engineering & Automation

## 🔗 Navigation
- [⬆ Parent](./../README.md)
- [🏠 Root](./../README.md)
- [📂 Current Directory](././)

## 📌 Overview
This directory serves as a central repository for generic, high-quality prompts designed to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. It focuses on accelerating the development lifecycle, from application generation to code optimization.

## 📁 Contents
- [app-generation](./app-generation/README.md): Prompts for scaffolding, prototyping, and building full applications.
- [code-improvement](./code-improvement/README.md): Prompts for refactoring, bug fixing, and technical debt reduction.
- [documentation](./documentation/README.md): Prompts for generating high-quality READMEs, Wikis, and technical docs.
- [system-design](./system-design/README.md): Prompts for architectural planning, database schema design, and system mapping.

## 🧠 Responsibilities
This section is responsible for maintaining "golden prompts" that produce consistent, reliable results. It aims to reduce repetitive manual effort and ensure that AI assistance is utilized effectively across the codebase.

## 🔄 Relationships
This directory is a direct child of the root. Its prompts are used to build and improve code documented in [development](./../development/README.md), deploy infrastructure defined in [infrastructure](./../infrastructure/README.md), and automate systems in [systems](./../systems/README.md).
